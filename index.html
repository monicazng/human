            "Monica played an instrumental role in my professional growth and success, forming a foundational pillar of support through my time as an individual contributor and later transition into technical management.<br>
            She became an indispensable companion with whom I could trust, challenge, be challenged, and reflect upon in another perspective. Most importantly in my constantly evolving role at a fast-moving start up, she strove to continually re-understand my personal situation to stay effective in widening my awareness and bringing clarity to new situations."<br>
            — CTO @ Aragon One

          <p>
            "Before coaching I was unproductive and feeling stuck, and after coaching I was able to pinpoint what was holding me back and unlock it.<br>
            Coaching is a mental health tool, like any other, with a purpose and objectives that have to serve you as an individual, in both your personal and professional lives. Monica helped me unlock my full potential and effectiveness by serving as a medium of the coaching process and guiding me through the steps necessary to complete my coaching with satisfying results."<br>
            — Co-founder and CTO @ Blockchain infrastructure startup
          </p>

            "The last person of the company I would have expected to go to a coach would be you. -- Let this phrase that I heard from my colleagues when I told them I had coaching sessions with Monica serve as a reference for my skepticism when I started the process.<br>
            I was very wrong.<br>
            The sessions were a natural process that helped me find the friction point in my professional performance from different points of view (from my performance goals to my soft skills). Working with Monica I felt like walking with someone searching for something. Far from 'motivational coaching' and without being an iron Sargeant, coaching sessions with Monica have a focus on clear goals that helped me to be conscious of my progress with measurable results, instead of sensations."<br>
